# customer-segmentation

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups of individuals that have similiar characteristics.  Using Python, we can apply statistical inference and data science techniques to transform our data to create clusters of consumers and a reccomendation system.  This is a data science project which utlizies techniques/algorithms such as

- K-means Clustering
    - Elbow Method
    - Silhouette Method
- Forest Isolation Algorithm
- Feature Engineering
- Mutlicollinearity Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Feature Scaling
- Evaluation Metrics
    - Silhouette Scoring
    - Calinski Harabasz Scoring
    - Davies Bouldin Scoring

With the use of these techniques and models, we were able to transform 556909 rows of data into a meaningful, accurate recomendation systems that recommends certain products to consumers based on their previous history/behaviour with the website.
